export default "# Part 1 - Game\r\n## Introduction\r\nThis is one of those projects which are born after a burst of excitement but you end up not \r\nfinishing it, to the #uncomfortable point were it isn\u2019t good enough to publish but it is \r\ngood enough to talk about it.\r\n\r\nDo we support emojis? \uD83E\uDDE0\r\n\r\nSome inlined `code` here and a test here: \'`\' wtf `\\``. \/\/ Backslashing is manually processed\r\n\r\nSo, in this series I will share with you how I retake this project and finish it to the MVP \r\npoint in ~~two weekends~~!\r\n\r\nAdding some code here:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n\r\n# This is some sample bash code\r\necho \"Let\'s try some _markdown_ ~~crazy~~ [shit](shit.com)\"\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis below should make the block fail\r\n```\r\nbla bla \"```\" The middle tick thinks that it\'s a SNIP_MIDDLE\r\nwhich probably means that this will fail as well: ### haha\r\n```\r\n\r\n## What the project is about\r\nI bought a _banana phone_ after watching some video about this (I don\u2019t remember exactly what \r\nvideo it was). The fact that I could create apps for a feature phone using web technologies \r\nblew my mind \u2014 I remember being a kid and creating what we now call \u201Cfeature phones\u201D using \r\nsmall and thin wood rectangles that (for some strange reason) were laying around in my \r\nhouse. I would make different designs using tape, rubber bands, nails and color markers.\r\n\r\n#### Just another test 4\r\n\r\n##### Just another test 5\r\n\r\n###### Just another test 6\r\n\r\nAnyways, I bought the thing and went on to enable development mode and got a Hello World \r\napp running.\r\n\r\nA few months past by and suddenly decided I wanted to do something with it. I though of \r\nremaking [How would we handle things like this where they wrap?](https:\/\/fergarram.itch.io\/\r\namateur-archaeology-iii) for a game jam some years ago using Game Maker. This was the perfect \r\nidea, the game was simple enough so I started on working on it.\r\n\r\n## Defining the MVP\r\nAs a starting point it should have the same functionalities as the original game with some \r\nvariations and additions:\r\n\r\n* Infinite diggin\' (done before this devlog started)\r\n* Intro screen\r\n* Dialogs (UI)\r\n* Treasures - with different rewards\r\n* Time, score and game states\r\n* Foes - Fire and Scorpions\r\n* Randomized hue (can change) \r\n\r\n### Game Rules\r\n1. Game objective is to reach the score goal before time runs out.\r\n2. If you pass the score goal you get extra time for the next level.\r\n\r\n## Day 1\r\nI\u2019ll start by taking the intro image from the original game and adapting it to the \r\nresolution of the Banana Phone (240 x 320px). I use [Aseprite](https:\/\/www.aseprite.org\/) \r\nfor manipulating pixels and [Sketch](https:\/\/www.sketch.com\/) for\u2026 level design? I like to \r\nuse Sketch for moving the assets around and prototyping ideas.\r\n";
