// In this grid most cells are unactivated or represent an empty cell but there are a few that have been given single values.

// Each cell can access their neighbors and based on that they can assume an identity, in the case of cell AB it's 100% certain it's a '#' character and it would be X% sure that it's part of a "heading 1" bigger holon because this cell has knowledge about what it can be a part of and what it takes to be a part of such a bigger holon based on its vision of its neighbors' value and (maybe) their assumptions about what they can be in the bigger scope.

// There might be a need for a second or more layers of cells that help with the bigger scopes. This might be needed for parallelism â€” supervision of a range of cells might execute faster when in parallel or it simply might not be possible otherwise.

// Maybe the first layer is static and thus it feels weird to only have "one" layer of cells but in reality it's two but one is static because the value is a static character.

// So what I need to do is create a representation of an ego cell.

// So, something like a dynamic "union" type that can become a value of 0 - 100% of an identity.

// The tendency to identify with a block will be defined by each cell's neighbors.
